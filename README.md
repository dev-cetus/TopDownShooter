## What's that?
TopDownShooter was the first game I made using Unreal Engine 5! <br>
I created the game as part of this training course: <https://youtu.be/hn98tbztoBg>
## What next?
I'm not going to limit myself to this training. By following other tutorials and testing on my own, I'll be adding new features. <br>
Below is a list of the features I plan to add.
